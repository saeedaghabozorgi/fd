    "## When should I build my own algorithm container?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not need to create a container to bring your own code to Amazon SageMaker. When you are using a framework such as Apache MXNet or TensorFlow that has direct support in SageMaker, you can simply supply the Python code that implements your algorithm using the SDK entry points for that framework. This set of supported frameworks is regularly added to, so you should check the current list to determine whether your algorithm is written in one of these common machine learning environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there is direct SDK support for your environment or framework, you may find it more effective to build your own container. If the code that implements your algorithm is quite complex or you need special additions to the framework, building your own container may be the right choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons to build an already supported framework container are:\n",
    "1. A specific version isn't supported.\n",
    "2. Configure and install your dependencies and environment.\n",
    "3. Use a different training/hosting solution than provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough shows that it is quite straightforward to build your own container. So you can still use SageMaker even if your use case is not covered by the deep learning containers that we've built for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this notebook requires permissions in addition to the normal `SageMakerFullAccess` permissions. This is because it creates new repositories in Amazon ECR. The easiest way to add these permissions is simply to add the managed policy `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess` to the role that you used to start your notebook instance. There's no need to restart your notebook instance when you do this, the new permissions will be available immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we show how to package a custom TensorFlow container with a Python example which works with the CIFAR-10 dataset and uses TensorFlow Serving for inference. However, different inference solutions other than TensorFlow Serving can be used by modifying the docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a single image to support training and hosting. This simplifies the procedure because we only need to manage one image for both tasks. Sometimes you may want separate images for training and hosting because they have different requirements. In this case, separate the parts discussed below into separate Dockerfiles and build two images. Choosing whether to use a single image or two images is a matter of what is most convenient for you to develop and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're only using Amazon SageMaker for training or hosting, but not both, only the functionality used needs to be built into your container.\n",
